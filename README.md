## How to run the app:

### As a Local HTML File:
Open page on the browser as a local file.

### As a Server:
YYou can be creative with that and use any complex or simple method you want. But here is a very simple method that I like: Assuming you have python installed on your system and the python module http.server, you can simply put the index.html file within a directory, `cd` to that directory and run the following command `python -m http.server 8080`. You can replace `8080` with any other available port. Then you can access the app at the address `localhost:8080`.
